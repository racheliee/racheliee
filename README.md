# üçí Hey, Nice to meet you 

## About Me
I'm an enthusiastic student double majoring in **Industrial Engineering** and **Computer Science & Engineering** at **Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU)**. Balancing these two exciting fields, I thrive on merging the efficiency and optimization skills from Industrial Engineering with the creativity and problem-solving prowess from Computer Science.

## My Interests
- **Coding & Development**: I love creating software solutions, whether it's a small script to automate a task or a full-fledged application.
- **Optimization**: Applying engineering principles to optimize processes and systems is my jam!
- **Data Analysis**: Turning raw data into meaningful insights is incredibly satisfying.

## Projects & Assignments
Here you'll find a collection of my projects and assignments from both my majors, showcasing my skills and passion for both IE and CSE.
